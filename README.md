In this Notebook we will be looking into graph signal processing, a fast-growing field that deals with signals that are defined on the vertex set of weighted graphs. We will be using PyGSP, a Python package for graph signal processing operations.

### What's in here?
Here you can find
- the notebook of the project

### Datasets
All the dataset we used are the default graph models provided by PyGSP (see https://pygsp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/graphs.html)
